Search Algorithmn is an algorithmn designed to solve a search problem.
Types are: Linear, Binary and Hashing
Linear Search checks every record fot the one associated with a target by a linear fashion
Binary Search searches repeatedly target then centres of the search structure and divide the search space in half
Hashing irectly maps keys to record based on hashing function
It is also the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed string size of text using a mathematical function
